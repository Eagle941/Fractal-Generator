--Student name: Giuseppe Stratis Afentoulis


To execute the program the following libraries have to be installed:
---base
---JuicyPixels

There are four files:
---Engine.hs -> The core of the program which states Haskell what calculation it has to do
---phi.hs -> The instructions for the first graph
---z2.hs --> The instructions for the second graph
---z3.hs --> The instructions for the third graph

To make the program start generating the image there are two steps:
---Open one of the three graph in ghci (phi.hs / z2.hs / z3.hs)
---Execute the command main in ghci
